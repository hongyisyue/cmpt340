Marks:  Question:

25     data structure for map

15=7+8 functions on list(no recursion) HOF function

10     built-in function, use it to built other function(not recursion, bur HOF)

12     concurrent, numbers of process for actor, asinquler?? channels (which channel are used?), use either actor or channel.

18=9+9 logical programming, 1)math definitely of some function(eg. fibonacci), how to write in prolog 2)develop search tree in prolog(last class don’t skip 'dun')
